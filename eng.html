            <h3 style="color: var(--main-color);">My Businesses and Professional Activity</h3>
            <p>I officially started my entrepreneurial activity in April 2025 as a sole proprietor. I’m currently working on two main projects, both reflecting my own ideas and skills.</p>
            <ul>
              <p>Senkisem EV: My own clothing brand, where I manage every step from visual design through production to digital marketing. The brand's goal is to create unique, high-quality design products that carry visual value.</p>
              <p>Signaler.hu: A website offering stock market indicators and trading tools that I design and develop. My goal is to create a platform that truly supports market decision-making. Programming, financial knowledge, and business thinking converge in this project.</p>
            </ul>

            <p>Since 2025, I’ve been working as a developer at aitrainer.hu, where we create innovative AI-based business solutions. My tasks include developing AI-based chatbots, MCP servers, data processing and workflow optimization tools, and implementing AI integrations into various business systems.

This job gives me the opportunity to apply and enhance the latest AI technologies in practice, while expanding my skills in programming, system design, and business logic.</p>
            <h3 style="color: var(--main-color);">Programming and Technology</h3>
            <p>Since early 2024, I have been intentionally developing my programming knowledge alongside my university studies through self-learning. I first gained a foundation in HTML, CSS, SCSS, and C++, and I’m currently focusing on learning Java, JavaScript, Python, and SQL at a junior level. I aim not only to gain technical knowledge but also to improve my problem-solving skills and systems thinking.</p>
          
            <h3 style="color: var(--main-color);">Financial Markets and Trading</h3>
            <p>Since 2020, I have been actively involved in stock trading, starting as a hobby, but now with a more systematic approach. I am deeply interested in understanding the mechanisms of financial markets, technical analysis, and investment strategies. My long-term goal is to build and manage my portfolio based on my own tools and software solutions.</p>
          
            <h3 style="color: var(--main-color);">Self-Improvement and Personal Skills</h3>
            <p>For me, growth is a holistic concept: it's important both mentally and physically. I practiced martial arts for years, which strengthened my perseverance and focus. I also read regularly – from professional materials to self-knowledge topics – because I believe knowledge comes from diverse sources.</p>
          
            <h3 style="color: var(--main-color);">Skills</h3>
            <p>In addition to my IT knowledge, my strengths include visual design, digital marketing (especially social media), and conscious, calm communication. I’ve been able to apply these skills during my studies, projects, and work experience.</p>

          <p>Since 2024, I’ve worked first as a manager for the Hungarian subsidiary, then as a Traffic Manager at a US-based social media marketing company. I contributed to social media activities, team management, and creative direction, coordinating multiple influencer projects.</p>
      
          <h3 style="color: var(--main-color);">Studies</h3>
          <p>I studied Health Care Management at the University of Debrecen. Although I paused my university studies in 2024, I gained numerous professional skills and knowledge during my university years.</p>
